DESCRIPTION
=========================================================================================================

This is a motion-detection-triggered video monitoring system. It detects motion and begins recording 
while simultaneously streaming the video, encrypted, to a remote server where it is stored encrypted with 
the user's private key.





MAIN CLASS
=========================================================================================================
The main class for this program is ClientMain.java. 

Run this class to run the system.






KNOWN ISSUES
=========================================================================================================
1.	Some differences between computers based on drivers. For example, some HP drivers delay the video
	selection process by having a popup that asks the user what device to use. This causes problems 
	with the internal selection system of the client. This issue is not prevalent in other laptops.
	(Be aware of some driver issues of JMF)
