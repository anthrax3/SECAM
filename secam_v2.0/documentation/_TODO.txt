The MotionDetector class is enormous.
It deals with web connection/broadcasting and motion detection.
We need to split these two up.

The new Control module will handle the new classes.

The new web connection/broadcasting class: 	WebConnectionManager (Singleton)
The new motion detection class:			MotionDetector

========================================================================

[TASK DONE IN 2.0]

Right now we have DBConnSingleton that is used ONLY to check if the given 
username and password are valid.

The connection code in MotionDetector is dealing with the streaming to both 
the harddrive file and the web applet.

The local streaming has to move to the DBConnSingleton.
The applet streaming has to move to the WebConnSingleton.

========================================================================

Need to extract the creating of files and storing of video files on hard 
disk. This should be its own class. The database manager will create an 
instance of this class and use it to save files to disc when a stream is 
created. [Right now the code is in the old motiondetector class mixed with 
the network broadcast code. the network stuff has been extracted, only need 
to get the file stuff now.]

This will also cause you to change the "StopBroadcastTask" class to access 
the new "filesaving" class via the database manager class and stop the 
saving process from there.
